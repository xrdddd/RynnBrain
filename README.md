## Introduction
We present **RynnBrain**, an embodied foundation model grounded in physical reality. RynnBrain is available in two dense variants (2B and 8B) and one mixture-of-experts (MoE) model (30B-A3B). 
In addition, we release three post‑trained models: RynnBrain‑Plan (**robot task planning**), RynnBrain‑Nav (**vision-language navigation**), and RynnBrain‑CoP (**chain-of-point reasoning**). 
<!-- RynnBrain‑Plan demonstrates the effectiveness of the fine‑grained manipulation‑planning paradigm that alternates between textual reasoning and localization. -->
<!-- RynnBrain‑Nav verifies that using RynnBrain as the foundation model can substantially enhance the performance ceiling of various embodied task models.  -->
<!-- Brain-CoP incorporates an interleaved reasoning mechanism that alternates between textual reasoning and spatial grounding, endowing it with physical-space reasoning capabilities.  -->

### 🌟 Key Highlights
* **Comprehensive egocentric understanding**: 
Excels in fine-grained video understanding and egocentric cognition, covering tasks such as embodied QA, counting, and OCR.
* **Diverse spatio-temporal localization**: 
Possesses powerful localization capabilities across episodic memory, enabling precise identification of objects, target areas, and motion trajectories.
* **Physical-space reasoning**: 
Employs an interleaved reasoning strategy that alternates between textual and spatial grounding, ensuring that its reasoning processes are firmly rooted in the physical environment.
* **Physics-aware precise planning**: 
Integrates located affordances and object information into planning, enabling downstream VLA models to execute intricate tasks with fine-grained instructions.

### Model Architecture
RynnBrain employs a unified architecture (supporting both Dense and MoE variants) to transform omni-vision inputs and textual instructions into multi-modal outputs, including spatial trajectories, physical pointing, and action planning. 
Through massive training on rich spatio-temporal, physical-space, and general knowledge data, RynnBrain maintains robust general-purpose capabilities while specializing in diverse, fine-grained embodied reasoning and complex planning tasks.

## Training

**Pretraining & Evaluation** 

Please refer to [RynnScale](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/RynnScale/tree/main/projects/rynn_brain) for details of pretraining and evaluation.


**Finetuning**

- [Reasoning](reasoning): RynnBrain introduces an **interleaved reasoning approach that combines grounding with textual information** directly within egocentric video streams. This paradigm effectively bridges the cognitive gap between language and the physical world, ensuring the reasoning process is robustly anchored
in reality. 

- [Navigation](navigation):
We trained a vision-language navigation model based on the RynnBrain base model. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that fine-tuning the vision-language model on RynnBrain yields superior performance compared to fine-tuning on other foundational models.

- [Planning](planning):
RynnBrain **integrates the location information of affordance, areas, and objects directly
into its planning outputs**. Consequently, even highly intricate and fine-grained tasks can be effectively addressed within our hierarchical RynnBrain-VLA system architecture.


## RynnBrain-Bench
We introduce **RynnBrain-Bench**, a high-dimensional benchmark for embodied understanding that evaluates models across four key dimensions: *object cognition*, *spatial cognition*, *grounding*, and *pointing*—highlighting fine-grained understanding and spatiotemporal localization across episodic video sequences.

For details, please refer to [RynnBrain-Bench](./rynnbrain-bench/README.md).
